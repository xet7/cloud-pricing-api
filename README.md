## Getting started

### Prerequisites

 * Node.js >= 14.15.0
 * MongoDB >= 4.4

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/infracost/cloud-pricing-api.git
  cd cloud-pricing-api
  ```

2. Add a `.env` file to point to your MongoDB server, e.g.

  ```
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/cloudPricing

  # If using GCP
  GCP_PROJECT=
  GCP_API_KEY=<GCP API Key> # An API key with access to the GCP Cloud Billing API
  GCP_KEY_FILE=gcp_creds.json # Credentials for a service account that has read-only access to Compute Engine.
  ```

3. Install the npm packages

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

4. Run npm build

  ```sh
  npm run-script build
  ```

5. Update the pricing data
   **Note: this downloads several GB of data**

  ```sh
  npm run update
  ```

  If you only want to download from a single source you can run:

  `Example: AWS Bulk`

  ```sh
  npm run update -- --only=aws:bulk
  ```

  `Example: Azure Retail`
  
  ```sh
  npm run update -- --only=azure:retail
  ```

## Usage

### Running locally

```
npm run dev
```

### Running in production

```
npm run-script build
npm run start
```

You can now access the GraphQL Playground at [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql).

## Future work

 * Additional vendors
 * A more user-friendly API - this will require adding mappings for all AWS services.
